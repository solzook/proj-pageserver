### What do I need? where will it work? ###
* Designed for Unix, mostly interoperable on Linuxhttps://github.com/solzook/proj-pageserver (Ubuntu) or MacOS.
  Target environment is Rasberry Pi.
  * May also work on Windows, but no promises. A Linux virtual machine may work, but our experience has not been good; if you don't have a Rasberry Pi in hand yet, you may want to test on shared server ix.
* You will need Python version 3.4 or higher.
* Designed to work in "user mode" (unprivileged), therefore using a port number above 1000
