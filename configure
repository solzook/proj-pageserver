# Notes: This is a very minimal configuration step, but 
# I've put it in a script called "configure" for 
# consistency with many other systems that expect you to 
# install a project with these commands: 
# ./configure
# make
# make install
# 
#
# For our projects, we will normally use this sequence instead
# make configure
# make run 
# 
# (We have configuration, but we don't have compilations per se
#  since we are working in Python, and we aren't installing the 
#  application outside the working directory.)
